Stash
-----

Stash is a fast and simple personal finance application.

Its core data-storage and serialisation files are written in C++, and there is an
existing (but somewhat old) native Mac OS interface written in Objective-C++ / Cocoa,
as well as a much more recent, Qt interface/port which now exists (for Linux).

Features
--------

* Easy-to-use interface to view and edit transactions
* Localised Dates and Currency formatting
* Multiple Accounts
* Split Transactions
* OFX Import/Export (1.0 and 2.0 versions)
* QIF Import/Export
* Scheduled Transactions
* Pie Chart Graphs
* Area Chart Graphs over time
* Overview Chart Graphs

Downloading

Stash is hosted on GitHub. Its project page is here:

If you want to download the source code, you can do the following:

git clone git://github.com/ppearson/Stash

Helping
-------

Any help with Stash is more than welcome. As mentioned above, Stash's core is written in
C++, with the Mac Cocoa interface written in Objective-C++, and a newer Qt interface written
in C++ (for Linux). The list of features still to be implemented in Stash that I hope to get to eventually is:

* Encryption of data files
* Import Rules
* CSV import/export
* Reports
* Budgets
* Multiple currencies
