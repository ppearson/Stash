Stash
-----

Basic CLI test program.

This sub-project program (CLI version of Stash) is an as-yet undeveloped command line version of Stash, that's currently only used for a bit of basic functionality testing on different platforms.

I did intend to develop it into a fairly fully-featured CLI version of Stash, but decided I didn't really need that, and the Qt port was much more useful.
